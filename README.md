# Intrusion-Detection
This repository is used to build a network intrusion detector, a predictive model capable of distinguishing between ``bad'' connections, called intrusions or attacks, and ``good'' normal connections. This database contains a standard set of data to be audited, which includes a wide variety of intrusions simulated in a military network environment. To see about the data visit the link: http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html.
